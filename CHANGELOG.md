# Changelog — UCPIS

UCPIS uses semantic versioning for public documentation releases.
All content is informative and non-normative unless explicitly stated.

## v1.4 — Harmonized Public Architecture Release (Locked)

**Status:** Stable (Informative / Non-Normative)  
**Release Year:** 2026

This release represents the first fully harmonized, institution-safe public
corpus of the UCPIS architecture.

UCPIS v1.4 consolidates the white paper, annexes, contextual rationale,
governance posture, reader guidance, and repository structure into a single,
internally consistent architectural reference suitable for public archival,
institutional review, and long-term interpretation.

UCPIS remains an **architecture**, not a product, platform, standard,
implementation, or certification program.

## Added

### Canonical & Architectural Documents

- **Annex F — Reference Implementation Guidelines**  
  *(Authored; explicitly deferred until executable artifacts exist)*

- **Annex G — Governance Models**  
  *(Authored deferral; governance not activated)*

- **Annex H — Interoperability Profiles**  
  *(Authored deferral; pending empirical evidence)*

---

### Reader Guidance & Interpretation Layer (`docs/`)

Introduced a structured reader-orientation layer to improve interpretability
and misuse resistance without expanding architectural authority:

- `docs/how-to-read-ucpis.md` — recommended reading order and interpretation
- `docs/ucpis-at-a-glance.md` — one-page classification of scope and non-goals
- `docs/document-map.md` — conceptual map of document relationships
- `docs/interpretation-notes.md` — explicit guardrails against misreading
- `docs/README.md` — documentation scope and non-authoritative posture

---

### Contextual Design & Rationale (WHY Layer)

Introduced a non-normative contextual layer to preserve architectural intent
without expanding scope or authority:

- `docs/notes/README.md` — notes directory posture and limits
- `docs/notes/interoperability-origin.md` — civilizational interoperability
  gap and architectural motivation
- `docs/notes/constrained-hmi-design-note.md` — rationale for constrained
  human–machine interfaces
- `docs/notes/v1.5-activation-criteria.md` — discipline document defining
  conditions under which a future v1.5 release would be justified

All contextual notes are **informative only** and do not define requirements,
interfaces, or governance.

---

### Repository Structure & Metadata

- `repository-structure.md` — canonical, layered repository organization
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — harmonized v1.4 release summary
- `CHANGELOG.md` — updated to reflect full v1.4 corpus
- `ATTRIBUTION.md` — historical authorship and attribution
- `CITATION.cff` — machine-readable citation metadata
- `How-to-Cite-UCPIS.md` — human-readable citation guidance
- `SECURITY.md` — explicit statement that no normative security controls exist
- `Governance_Without_Capture.md` — governance posture statement

---

### Prompt & Reproducibility Artifacts (`prompts/`)

- `UCPIS_White_Paper_Master_Prompt.md` — canonical public prompt used to
  reproduce the v1.4 corpus in a consistent, institution-safe manner
- `UCPIS_v1.5_Upgrade_Knowledge_Transfer_Prompt.md` — internal continuity and
  intent-preservation artifact (does not activate v1.5)
- `prompts/README.md` — scope and non-authoritative status of prompt artifacts

Prompt artifacts are **not architecture** and define no scope or authority.

---

## Updated

### UCPIS White Paper v1.4
- Unified into a single coherent narrative
- Corrected to a three-layer conceptual architecture
- Clarified interface-first and agent-agnostic framing
- Added explicit environmental and biological context
- Tightened MVUE definition to conceptual-only framing
- Clarified governance-without-capture posture
- Added a non-normative Preface framing the interoperability problem

---

### Annex A — Definitions, Terminology, and Taxonomy
- Formalized Human Autonomy Classes as informational and non-evaluative
- Clarified authority as human-only
- Added non-human biological entities as environmental context only

---

### Annex C — Reference Architecture
- Integrated environmental and biological interaction
- Clarified human participation via autonomy classes
- Elevated language to system-of-systems architectural framing

---

### Annex D — Threat Model & Resilience
- Expanded human-in-the-loop and automation failure considerations
- Added environmental and biological interaction as resilience factors
- Reinforced resilience as architectural absorption, not control prescription

---

### Annex E — Standards Alignment & Mapping
- Clarified alignment-only posture (no compliance or authority claims)
- Expanded mapping to public-domain civic and open-systems principles

---

### Repository READMEs
- Updated root `README.md`
- Added `annexes/README.md`
- Added `white-paper/README.md`
- Updated `docs/README.md`
- Updated `docs/notes/README.md`
- Added `prompts/README.md`

Each README explicitly defines scope boundaries and authority limits.

---

## Clarified

- UCPIS defines **no normative security controls**
- UCPIS asserts **no governance authority**
- Interfaces are agent-agnostic; authority and accountability are human-only
- Animals and wildlife are environmental context, not agents
- MVUE is conceptual only in v1.4
- Deferred annexes remain inactive until justified by evidence
- Contextual documents preserve intent only and do not expand scope

---

## Confirmed Non-Goals

UCPIS v1.4 does **not** define or imply:

- Products or implementations
- Security mandates or assurance guarantees
- Compliance or certification regimes
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Performance targets or timelines
- Adoption forecasts or roadmaps

---

## Notes

This release finalizes and locks the UCPIS v1.4 architecture and its supporting
interpretive materials.

Any future changes that expand scope, authority, or execution would require a
separately justified version (e.g., v1.5).

No earlier versions are considered canonical.

## v1.4 — Public White Paper Harmonized Release

**Status:** Stable (Informative / Non-Normative)

This release represents the first fully harmonized public corpus of the
UCPIS architecture, including the white paper, annexes, governance posture,
security position, and supporting repository documentation.

---

### Added

- Annex F — Reference Implementation Guidelines *(authored; explicitly deferred until executable artifacts exist)*
- Annex G — Governance Models *(authored deferral; governance not activated)*
- Annex H — Interoperability Profiles *(authored deferral; pending empirical evidence)*
- Governance Without Capture statement (`Governance-Without-Capture.md`)
- `SECURITY.md` clarifying architectural security posture
- `repository-structure.md` documenting canonical repository layout
- Updated `index.md` as canonical public landing page
- Updated `README.md` aligned with v1.4 architecture and scope
- Updated master generation prompt (`UCPIS_White_Paper_Master_Prompt.md`)

---

### Updated

- **UCPIS White Paper v1.4**
  - Reordered and unified structure (single coherent narrative)
  - Corrected layer model to three-layer conceptual architecture
  - Added explicit environmental and biological context
  - Clarified governance-without-capture posture
  - Tightened MVUE definition to conceptual-only framing
  - Removed duplicated or conflicting architectural descriptions

- **Annex A — Definitions, Terminology, and Taxonomy**
  - Formalized Human Autonomy Classes as informational, non-evaluative constructs
  - Added Non-Human Biological Actors as environmental context
  - Explicitly excluded animals from agency, authority, and governance

- **Annex C — Reference Architecture**
  - Integrated environmental and biological interaction
  - Clarified human integration by autonomy class
  - Elevated architecture language to system-of-systems framing

- **Annex D — Threat Model & Resilience**
  - Expanded human-in-the-loop failure modes
  - Added environmental and biological interaction as resilience factors
  - Reinforced architectural (not control-level) threat modeling

- **Annex E — Standards Alignment & Mapping**
  - Clarified alignment with public-domain civic principles
  - Reaffirmed alignment-only posture (no compliance or authority claims)

---

### Clarified

- UCPIS defines **no normative security controls**
- UCPIS asserts **no governance authority**
- Interfaces may be agent-agnostic; authority and accountability are human-only
- Non-human biological entities are treated as environmental context, not agents
- Governance, interoperability profiles, and reference implementations are
  intentionally deferred pending real-world adoption and evidence

---

### Confirmed

- No compliance, certification, or enforcement mechanisms
- No product, platform, or implementation claims
- No security mandates or assurance guarantees
- No performance promises, timelines, or adoption forecasts
- All annexes are informative and non-normative unless explicitly stated

---

### Notes

This release consolidates and harmonizes prior draft material into a
single, internally consistent architectural corpus suitable for public
archival, institutional review, and future reference.

No earlier versions are considered public or canonical.

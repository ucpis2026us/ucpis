# Security Statement

UCPIS v1.4 defines **no normative security controls**.

Security is treated as a **context-dependent constraint** that must be
addressed by implementers, operators, regulators, or independent
standards bodies.

No security profiles, threat mitigations, or assurance claims are
mandated or implied by this work.

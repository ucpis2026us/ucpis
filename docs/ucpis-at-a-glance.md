# UCPIS at a Glance

**Project:** Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)  
**Version Context:** v1.4  
**Status:** Informative / Non-Normative  

---

## What It Is

UCPIS is a **reference architecture** for thinking about interoperability among
cyber-physical systems.

It provides:
- a layered conceptual model,
- interface-first reasoning,
- explicit treatment of human participation,
- integration of physical, cyber, and environmental constraints.

---

## What It Is Not

UCPIS is **not**:
- a product or platform
- a standard or protocol
- an implementation guide
- a certification or compliance regime
- a governance authority

---

## Core Idea (One Sentence)

> Interoperability in cyber-physical systems is an architectural problem, not
> a vendor integration problem.

---

## Architecture Snapshot

- **Layer 1:** Physical systems (machines, energy, logistics)
- **Layer 2:** Human mediation (Constrained HMIs)
- **Layer 3:** Cyber control and governance logic

Interfaces—not implementations—are the primary unit of interoperability.

---

## Status

- Public
- Informative
- Non-normative
- Stable as of v1.4

---

## Intended Audience

- Systems engineers
- Infrastructure planners
- Policymakers and regulators
- Researchers
- Architects of long-lived systems

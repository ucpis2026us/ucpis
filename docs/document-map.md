# UCPIS Document Map

**Project:** Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)  
**Status:** Informative / Non-Normative  

---

## Purpose

This document explains how the major UCPIS documents relate to one another.

It is a **navigation and interpretation aid**, not a specification and not a
source of architectural authority.

---

## Conceptual Structure

UCPIS documentation is intentionally layered to separate **rationale,
architecture, elaboration, and reader orientation**.

### WHY — Rationale and Design Intent

Contextual documents that explain *why* architectural choices were made.
These documents preserve intent but do not define behavior or scope.

- `docs/notes/`
  - `interoperability-origin.md`
  - `constrained-hmi-design-note.md`
  - `v1.5-activation-criteria.md`

---

### WHAT — Canonical Architecture

The authoritative architectural definition of UCPIS.

- `white-paper/`
  - `UCPIS White Paper v1.4`
  - `README.md` (white paper orientation)

---

### DEPTH — Architectural Elaboration

Structured expansion of the architecture into specific dimensions.
Annexes elaborate but do not override the white paper.

- `annexes/`
  - **Annex A–E** — Active (Definitions, Architecture, Threats, Alignment)
  - **Annex F–H** — Deferred (Implementation, Governance, Profiles)
  - `README.md` (annex status and posture)

---

### ENTRY — Public Orientation

Top-level documents intended to orient first-time readers and reviewers.

- `index.md` — Canonical public landing page
- `README.md` — Repository orientation and contribution context

---

### READER GUIDANCE — How to Interpret the Corpus

Documents that help readers navigate and correctly interpret UCPIS materials.

- `docs/`
  - `how-to-read-ucpis.md`
  - `ucpis-at-a-glance.md`
  - `interpretation-notes.md`
  - `README.md` (documentation orientation)

---

## Interpretation Guidance

When reading UCPIS, keep the following principles in mind:

- **More pages ≠ more authority**  
  Depth exists to clarify, not to prescribe.

- **Elaboration ≠ implementation**  
  Annexes and notes do not imply readiness or obligation.

- **Deferral ≠ incompleteness**  
  Deferred material is intentionally gated on evidence.

- **Context ≠ canon**  
  If a conflict appears, the white paper and active annexes take precedence.

Each layer serves a distinct role and should be read accordingly.

---

## Summary

The UCPIS document structure is designed to support:

- long-term interpretability,
- institutional review,
- resistance to scope creep,
- and disciplined architectural evolution.

Understanding *where* a document sits is as important as understanding
*what* it says.

# UCPIS Document Map

**Project:** Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)  
**Status:** Informative / Non-Normative  

---

## Purpose

This document explains how the major UCPIS documents relate to one another.

It is a **navigation and interpretation aid**, not a specification and not a
source of architectural authority.

---

## Conceptual Structure

UCPIS documentation is intentionally layered to separate **rationale,
architecture, elaboration, and reader orientation**.

Understanding *where* a document sits in this structure is essential to
understanding *how it should be read*.

---

## WHY — Rationale and Design Intent

Contextual documents that explain *why* architectural choices were made.

These documents preserve intent and motivation but **do not define behavior,
scope, interfaces, or authority**.

- `docs/notes/`
  - `interoperability-origin.md`  
    *Civilizational and architectural motivation for UCPIS*
  - `constrained-hmi-design-note.md`  
    *Design rationale for Constrained Human–Machine Interfaces*
  - `v1.5-activation-criteria.md`  
    *Discipline document defining conditions for future version activation*
  - `README.md`  
    *Scope and non-authoritative posture of contextual notes*

---

## WHAT — Canonical Architecture

The authoritative architectural definition of UCPIS v1.4.

These documents define the architecture and take precedence over all others.

- `white-paper/`
  - `UCPIS_White_Paper_v1.4.md`  
    *Canonical public reference architecture*
  - `README.md`  
    *Orientation and non-normative posture for the white paper*

---

## DEPTH — Architectural Elaboration

Structured expansion of the architecture into specific dimensions.

Annexes **elaborate but do not override** the white paper.

- `annexes/`
  - **Annex A–E** — Active  
    *Definitions, reference architecture, threat model, standards alignment*
  - **Annex F–H** — Deferred  
    *Implementation guidance, governance models, interoperability profiles*
  - `README.md`  
    *Annex scope, status, and deferral posture*

---

## ENTRY — Public Orientation

Top-level documents intended to orient first-time readers, reviewers, and
institutions.

- `index.md`  
  *Canonical public landing page*
- `README.md`  
  *Repository overview, scope, and non-goals*

---

## READER GUIDANCE — How to Interpret the Corpus

Documents that help readers understand **how to read UCPIS correctly**, without
adding scope or authority.

- `docs/`
  - `architecture-overview.md`  
    *Concise, explanatory summary of the UCPIS v1.4 architecture  
    (derivative; introduces no new architecture)*
  - `how-to-read-ucpis.md`  
    *Recommended reading order and interpretation guidance*
  - `ucpis-at-a-glance.md`  
    *One-page classification of what UCPIS is and is not*
  - `document-map.md`  
    *This document*
  - `interpretation-notes.md`  
    *Explicit guardrails against common misinterpretations*
  - `README.md`  
    *Orientation and posture for reader-guidance materials*

---

## Interpretation Guidance

When reading UCPIS, keep the following principles in mind:

- **More pages ≠ more authority**  
  Depth exists to clarify, not to prescribe.

- **Elaboration ≠ implementation**  
  Annexes and notes do not imply readiness or obligation.

- **Deferral ≠ incompleteness**  
  Deferred material is intentionally gated on evidence.

- **Context ≠ canon**  
  If a conflict appears, the white paper and active annexes take precedence.

Each layer serves a distinct role and should be read accordingly.

---

## Summary

The UCPIS document structure is designed to support:

- long-term interpretability,
- institutional review,
- resistance to scope creep,
- and disciplined architectural evolution.

Understanding *where* a document sits is as important as understanding
*what* it says.

# Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)

**Version:** v1.4  
**Status:** Public, Informative White Paper

---

The Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS) is an
informative architectural framework for understanding how heterogeneous
cyber-physical systems may interoperate through a layered,
interface-first model.

UCPIS is **not** a product, platform, standard, or implementation.

---

## What UCPIS Provides

- A conceptual cyber-physical architecture
- Interface-first interoperability framing
- Human participation constraints
- Constraint-aware system reasoning

---

## What UCPIS Does Not Provide

- No implementations
- No security mandates
- No compliance or certification
- No enforcement mechanisms

---

The **Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)** is an open,
non-proprietary reference architecture for coordinating artificial
intelligence, autonomous machines, manufacturing systems, logistics
networks, energy infrastructure, and human governance.

UCPIS defines a layered, interface-first architectural framework intended
to reduce fragmentation across cyber-physical systems by enabling
interoperability, modular substitution, and constraint-aware coordination.

## Status

- Public Reference Architecture v0.1

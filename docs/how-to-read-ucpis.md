# How to Read UCPIS

**Project:** Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)  
**Applies To:** Public White Paper v1.4 and associated materials  
**Status:** Informative / Non-Normative  

---

## Purpose of This Guide

This document explains **how to read, interpret, and navigate** the UCPIS
documentation set.

UCPIS is an architectural reference, not a product, standard, or implementation.
Readers approaching it with expectations shaped by software specifications,
regulatory frameworks, or vendor documentation may misinterpret its intent.

This guide exists to prevent that outcome.

## What Kind of Document Is UCPIS?

UCPIS is a **reference architecture**.

It:
- describes an architectural problem space,
- proposes a layered conceptual framing,
- defines interfaces and constraints at a high level,
- and deliberately avoids prescribing solutions.

It does **not**:
- mandate behavior,
- define compliance requirements,
- certify implementations,
- or assert institutional authority.

## Recommended Reading Order

For most readers, the recommended order is:

1. **`index.md`**  
   Public landing page; establishes scope and non-goals.

2. **UCPIS White Paper v1.4**  
   The canonical architectural reference.

3. **Annex A**  
   Definitions, terminology, and taxonomy used throughout the corpus.

4. **Other Annexes (B–E)**  
   As needed for depth on specific topics.

5. **Contextual Notes (`docs/notes/`)**  
   Optional background and design rationale.

---

## Canonical vs Contextual Material

UCPIS materials are intentionally layered:

- **Canonical**
  - White Paper
  - Annexes A–E
  - Release Notes, Changelog

- **Contextual**
  - `docs/notes/`
  - Design notes
  - Rationale and origin documents

Contextual documents explain *why* certain choices were made but do not define
UCPIS behavior or scope.

If any conflict appears, **canonical documents take precedence**.

## How Not to Read UCPIS

Common misreadings include:

- Treating UCPIS as a standard or protocol  
- Searching for implementation guidance  
- Looking for policy mandates or enforcement mechanisms  
- Interpreting diagrams as system designs  

These interpretations are incorrect.

UCPIS exists to support **reasoned architectural thinking**, not execution.

---

## Summary

UCPIS should be read as:
- a long-horizon architectural reference,
- a tool for asking better questions,
- and a shared conceptual language.

It is intentionally incomplete by design.

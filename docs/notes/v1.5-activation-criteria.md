# v1.5 Activation Criteria (Parking Document)

**Project:** Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)  
**Status:** Informative / Non-Normative  
**Purpose:** Self-restraint and version discipline  

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document records the **conditions under which a v1.5 release would be
justified**.

It does not propose changes and does not initiate v1.5 work.

---

## Why This Exists

Architectural integrity is best preserved by **not evolving until evidence
demands it**.

This document prevents:
- premature expansion,
- reactive edits,
- narrative drift.

---

## Potential Activation Conditions (Non-Exhaustive)

v1.5 may be considered only if one or more of the following occur:

- Existence of real **MVUE artifacts** exercising UCPIS interfaces
- Multi-party experimentation across organizations
- Demonstrated cross-vendor or cross-domain interoperability
- External institutional interest requiring clarification
- Identified ambiguities that cannot be resolved by notes or annexes

---

## Explicit Non-Triggers

The following do **not** justify a new version:

- Hypothetical use cases
- Internal desire for completeness
- Requests for implementation guidance
- Market narratives or hype
- Single-vendor experiments

---

## Status

Until activation criteria are met:
- v1.4 remains canonical
- all new thinking belongs in notes
- no architectural changes are implied

---

**End of v1.5 Activation Criteria**

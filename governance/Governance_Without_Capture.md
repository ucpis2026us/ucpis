# Governance Statement

UCPIS asserts **no governance authority**.

Governance is treated as a downstream concern, activated only if and
when multiple independent stakeholders adopt or steward the framework.

See **Annex G — Governance Models** for criteria governing any future
discussion of stewardship.

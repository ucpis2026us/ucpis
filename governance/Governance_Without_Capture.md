UCPIS asserts **no governance authority**.

The Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack is an architectural and
interoperability framework, not a governing body, standards authority, or
certification regime.

Governance is treated as a **downstream, conditional concern**, activated only
if and when multiple independent stakeholders adopt, extend, or steward the
framework in real-world contexts.

## Governance Without Capture

UCPIS is intentionally designed to resist premature or centralized capture.

Accordingly:
- No individual, organization, or vendor is granted inherent authority
- No compliance, certification, or enforcement power is implied
- No governance structure is defined in advance of adoption
- No technical artifact is treated as binding precedent

Governance, if ever activated, exists to **constrain power**, not to centralize it.

## Human Accountability and Authority

Consistent with UCPIS architectural principles:

- Governance authority, if defined, is exercised **only by human actors**
- Accountability is explicit, reviewable, and bounded
- Automated systems, AI, and non-human biological entities do **not**
  hold governance authority or decision rights

Human dignity and responsibility remain foundational.

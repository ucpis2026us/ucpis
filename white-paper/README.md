# UCPIS White Paper

**Project:** Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)  
**Document Type:** Public White Paper  
**Version Context:** v1.4  
**Status:** Informative / Non-Normative

## Purpose of This Document

The UCPIS White Paper is the **canonical architectural reference** for the
Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack.

It defines:
- the conceptual scope of UCPIS,
- the layered interoperability model,
- architectural constraints and assumptions,
- and the non-normative posture of the project.

The white paper is intended for **readers and reviewers**, not as a
specification for implementation or compliance.

---

## Normative Status

The UCPIS White Paper is **informative and non-normative**.

It:
- defines **no compliance requirements**,
- mandates **no security controls**,
- establishes **no governance authority**,
- and does **not** function as a standard, protocol, or certification basis.

Architectural concepts defined here are descriptive and explanatory. Any
interpretation implying enforcement, obligation, or readiness is incorrect.

---

## Relationship to Annexes

The white paper provides the **core architectural framing** for UCPIS.
It is complemented by a set of annexes that elaborate on specific topics.

- **Annexes A–E** expand and clarify the architecture (active in v1.4).
- **Annexes F–H** are authored but **explicitly deferred** pending evidence
  from executable artifacts, adoption, or governance needs.

Annexes do not override the white paper. If discrepancies arise, the white
paper takes precedence.

See `/annexes/README.md` for detailed annex status and descriptions.

---

## Relationship to Contextual Notes

Design rationale, historical motivation, and explanatory material that is not
part of the canonical architecture are intentionally kept **outside** the white
paper.

Such material resides in:
- `docs/notes/`

These notes:
- preserve architectural intent,
- support interpretation and review,
- do not define UCPIS behavior or scope.

The white paper does not depend on contextual notes.

## Versioning and Stability

This white paper is versioned explicitly.

- **v1.4** represents a stable, public, informational release.
- Changes occur only through explicit version updates.
- No implicit evolution, roadmap, or authority is implied.

Future versions, if any, will prioritize clarity and interpretability over
expanded scope.

## How to Read This Document

Readers are encouraged to:
1. Read the white paper end-to-end for architectural framing.
2. Consult Annex A for definitions and terminology.
3. Refer to other annexes as needed for depth.
4. Treat contextual notes as explanatory, not authoritative.

---

## Summary

The UCPIS White Paper exists to describe an architectural space, not to occupy
it.

It is designed to support long-term public reference, cross-disciplinary
discussion, and careful reasoning about interoperability in cyber-physical
systems—without prescribing solutions or asserting control.

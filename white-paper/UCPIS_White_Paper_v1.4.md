## Executive Summary

The **Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)** is an
informative reference architecture describing how heterogeneous
cyber-physical systems may interoperate through a **layered,
interface-first model**.

UCPIS is not a product, platform, standard, or implementation. It defines
**no compliance requirements**, **no certifications**, and **no normative
security controls**.

The architecture integrates **physical systems, human participation,
automation, governance constraints, and environmental context** into a
coherent interoperability framework suitable for public infrastructure,
industrial systems, and long-lived national capabilities.

---

## 1. Purpose

UCPIS exists to:

- Reduce fragmentation across cyber-physical systems
- Enable interface-first reasoning across physical, human, and cyber domains
- Treat real-world constraints (energy, labor, safety, governance, environment)
  as **first-class architectural inputs**
- Support resilience through structural design rather than ad hoc mitigation

---

## 2. Scope and Non-Goals

### In Scope
- Conceptual reference architecture
- Interface-first interoperability framing
- Human participation constraints (by reference)
- Environmental and biological context
- Informative threat and resilience principles

### Out of Scope
- Product specifications or vendor guidance
- Implementation requirements or roadmaps
- Security controls, profiles, or mandates
- Compliance, certification, or enforcement
- Performance guarantees or timelines

---

## 3. Architectural Overview

UCPIS defines a **three-layer conceptual architecture**, operating within a
broader environmental and socio-technical context.

### Layer 1 — Physical
Machines, robots, sensors, actuators, energy systems, and logistics assets.

### Layer 2 — Human Interface / Mediation
Constrained human–machine interfaces, guided workflows, confirmation,
escalation, and exception handling.

### Layer 3 — Cyber / Control / Governance
Orchestration, scheduling, policy definition, audit, coordination, and
system-level oversight.

Interfaces — not implementations — are the primary unit of interoperability.

---

## 4. Constraints as First-Class Architectural Inputs

UCPIS treats constraints as shaping forces on interface design, including:

- Energy availability and electrical load
- Human labor capability and autonomy
- Safety boundaries and hazard containment
- Governance, legitimacy, and auditability
- Environmental and biological context

Constraints are integrated structurally rather than handled as exceptions.

---

## 5. Human Participation Model (By Reference)

UCPIS models human participation through **Human Autonomy Classes**, defined
in **Annex A — Definitions, Terminology, and Taxonomy**.

These classes:
- Are functional and contextual
- Constrain interface exposure and authority
- Do not assign value, status, or worth

Detailed class definitions are intentionally excluded from this document.

---

## 6. Environmental and Biological Context

UCPIS explicitly acknowledges that cyber-physical systems operate in
real-world environments that may include **non-human biological entities**
(e.g., wildlife).

Such entities:
- Are not system agents or authorities
- Are not governance participants
- Influence safety, resilience, and design constraints

Environmental and biological interaction is treated as **context**, not agency.

---

## 7. Minimum Viable UCPIS-Executable (MVUE)

The **Minimum Viable UCPIS-Executable (MVUE)** is a conceptual definition
describing the smallest executable artifact capable of exercising UCPIS
interfaces across layers.

MVUEs:
- Demonstrate interface viability
- Enable testing and replay
- Do not constitute implementations or reference systems

UCPIS v1.4 defines **no executable artifacts**.

---

## 8. Interoperability as the Core Contribution

Interoperability within UCPIS is defined by:

- Interface-level substitution
- Event-based coordination
- Cross-domain composability
- Graceful degradation under constraint

Interoperability is architectural, not contractual.

---

## 9. Threat Model and Resilience (By Reference)

UCPIS treats human variability, automation failure, and environmental
interaction as **expected operating conditions**, not exceptional faults.

Threat modeling and resilience principles are defined in **Annex D**.

No normative security controls are defined.

---

## 10. Governance Position

UCPIS asserts **no governance authority**.

Governance is treated as a downstream, conditional concern, activated only
if and when multiple independent stakeholders adopt or steward the
architecture.

This posture is defined in **Annex G** and the governance-without-capture
statement.

---

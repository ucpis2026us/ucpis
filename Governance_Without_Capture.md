UCPIS asserts **no governance authority**.

The Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack is an architectural and
interoperability framework, not a governing body, standards authority, or
certification regime.

Governance is treated as a **downstream, conditional concern**, activated only
if and when multiple independent stakeholders adopt, extend, or steward the
framework in real-world contexts.

---

## Governance Without Capture

UCPIS is intentionally designed to resist premature or centralized capture.

Accordingly:
- No individual, organization, or vendor is granted inherent authority
- No compliance, certification, or enforcement power is implied
- No governance structure is defined in advance of adoption
- No technical artifact is treated as binding precedent

Governance, if ever activated, exists to **constrain power**, not to centralize it.

---

## Human Accountability and Authority

Consistent with UCPIS architectural principles:

- Governance authority, if defined, is exercised **only by human actors**
- Accountability is explicit, reviewable, and bounded
- Automated systems, AI, and non-human biological entities do **not**
  hold governance authority or decision rights

Human dignity and responsibility remain foundational.

---

## Environmental and Biological Context

UCPIS architectures may operate in environments that include non-human
biological entities (e.g., wildlife), as described in Annex A.13 and Annex C.

Such entities:
- Are not governance participants
- Are not stakeholders or representatives
- Do not confer authority or obligation

Their presence informs **design constraints and resilience**, not governance.

## Relationship to Annex G

Criteria governing any future discussion of stewardship or governance models
are defined in **Annex G — Governance Models**.

Until those criteria are met, this statement remains the authoritative position:
**UCPIS operates without governance.**

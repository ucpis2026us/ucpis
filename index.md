# Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)

**Version:** v1.4  
**Status:** Public, Informative / Non-Normative White Papers

---

The **Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)** is an
informative reference architecture describing how heterogeneous
cyber-physical systems may interoperate through a **layered,
interface-first model**.

UCPIS is **not** a product, platform, standard, or implementation.
It defines **no compliance requirements**, **no certifications**, and
**no enforcement mechanisms**.

This page serves as the **canonical public landing page** for the UCPIS
white paper corpus.

---

## What UCPIS Provides

- A conceptual cyber-physical reference architecture
- Interface-first interoperability framing
- A structured human participation model (by reference)
- Constraint-aware system reasoning
- Architectural treatment of energy, safety, governance, and environment
- Informative guidance suitable for public infrastructure and industry

---

## What UCPIS Does Not Provide

- No implementations or products
- No security mandates or profiles
- No compliance or certification regimes
- No governance authority or enforcement
- No performance guarantees or timelines

---

## Architectural Summary

UCPIS defines a **three-layer conceptual architecture**, operating within
a broader socio-technical and environmental context:

1. **Layer 1 — Physical**  
   Machines, robots, sensors, actuators, energy systems, and logistics assets

2. **Layer 2 — Human Interface / Mediation**  
   Constrained HMIs, guided workflows, confirmation and escalation paths

3. **Layer 3 — Cyber / Control / Governance**  
   Orchestration, scheduling, policy definition, audit, and coordination logic

Interfaces — not implementations — are the primary unit of interoperability.

---

## Environmental and Biological Context

UCPIS explicitly acknowledges that cyber-physical systems operate in real
environments that may include **non-human biological entities** (e.g.,
wildlife).

Such entities:
- Are not system agents or authorities
- Are not governance participants
- Influence safety, resilience, and design constraints

Environmental and biological interaction is treated as **context**, not agency.

## Governance Position

UCPIS asserts **no governance authority**.

Governance is treated as a downstream, conditional concern, activated only
if and when multiple independent stakeholders adopt or steward the
architecture.

See:
- **Annex G — Governance Models**
- `/governance/governance-without-capture.md`

## Status and Maturity

- Stable public informational release (v1.4)
- Architecture defined; implementations are future work
- Informative and non-normative
- Designed for long-term public archival and reference

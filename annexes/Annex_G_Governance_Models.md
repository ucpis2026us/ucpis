## G.0 Purpose and Intent

This annex is reserved for future discussion of **governance models** applicable
to stewardship of the Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)
in contexts of real-world adoption.

In UCPIS, governance is treated as a **downstream and conditional concern**.
No governance structure is asserted, implied, or activated in advance of
demonstrated, multi-party use of the architecture.

This deferral is intentional and serves to:
- Prevent premature institutionalization
- Avoid capture by any single organization or interest
- Preserve architectural neutrality and adaptability

---

## G.1 Preconditions for Governance Activation

This annex will be authored and published **only after** one or more of the
following conditions are met:

- Sustained external adoption of UCPIS concepts across independent efforts
- Participation by multiple, unaffiliated organizations or implementers
- Explicit delegation of stewardship responsibilities by adopters
- Demonstrated need for coordination beyond informal consensus

Absent these conditions, governance remains **out of scope**.

---

## G.2 Governance Scope Boundaries (When Activated)

If and when published, this annex may describe **informative governance patterns**
rather than prescriptive authority structures.

Potential topics include:
- Stewardship and caretaking roles
- Change proposal and review processes
- Transparency and public documentation norms
- Anti-capture and anti-monopolization safeguards
- Alignment with public-interest and open-systems principles

No governance model defined here would:
- Assert legal authority
- Mandate compliance or certification
- Override local regulatory regimes
- Grant agency or standing to non-human entities

---

## G.3 Human Accountability and Authority

Consistent with Annex A and Annex D:

- Governance authority, if defined, is exercised **only by human actors**
- Accountability is explicit, reviewable, and bounded
- No automated system, AI, or non-human biological entity may hold
  governance authority or decision rights

Governance mechanisms are intended to **constrain power**, not to centralize it.

---

## G.4 Environmental and Biological Context (Informational)

UCPIS operates in environments that may include non-human biological entities,
as described in Annex A.13 and Annex C.

Governance models, if later defined:
- Do not assign agency, responsibility, or representation to animals or wildlife
- Treat environmental and biological factors as contextual constraints
- Frame safety and resilience as design responsibilities of human stewards

This preserves biological dignity without conflating governance with control.

---

## G.5 Relationship to Threat Model and Resilience

Governance in UCPIS, if activated, is expected to support resilience by:

- Encouraging structural mitigation of risk rather than punitive response
- Requiring explicit documentation of assumptions and constraints
- Promoting review and separation of authority in high-impact decisions

Governance mechanisms are not substitutes for architectural safety or
technical resilience.

---

## G.6 Current Status

No governance model is currently defined.

This annex remains **intentionally deferred** in UCPIS v1.4 to ensure that
governance emerges from real-world use, not speculation or preemptive control.

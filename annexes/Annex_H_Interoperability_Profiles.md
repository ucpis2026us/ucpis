## Purpose

This annex is reserved for future definition of **interoperability profiles**
derived from empirical pilot deployments aligned with UCPIS.

Interoperability profiles describe constrained subsets of interfaces and
behaviors suitable for specific operational contexts.

---

## Publication Criteria

This annex will be authored and published **only after**:

- Pilot deployments or simulations exist
- Cross-vendor or cross-system interoperability is demonstrated
- Empirical evidence supports profile definition

Profiles will not be defined purely from theory.

---

## Scope (When Published)

When activated, this annex may include:

- Domain-specific profiles (e.g., manufacturing, logistics, energy)
- Optional interface subsets
- Interoperability test conditions
- Known limitations and assumptions

Profiles will remain **non-normative** unless explicitly elevated by an
independent standards process.

---

## Current Status

No interoperability profiles are currently defined.

This annex is intentionally deferred pending real-world evidence.

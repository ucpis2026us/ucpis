## H.0 Purpose and Intent

This annex is reserved for future definition of **interoperability profiles**
derived from empirical pilot deployments aligned with the Universal
Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS).

Interoperability profiles describe **constrained, context-specific subsets**
of interfaces, behaviors, and assumptions that have been demonstrated to
interoperate in practice.

Profiles are descriptive artifacts derived from evidence, not prescriptive
standards.

---

## H.1 Preconditions for Profile Definition

This annex will be authored and published **only after** all of the following
conditions are met:

- Pilot deployments or high-fidelity simulations exist
- Cross-vendor or cross-system interoperability is demonstrated
- Empirical evidence supports the stability of a constrained interface set
- Documented limitations and failure modes are understood

Profiles will not be defined purely from theoretical architecture or design intent.

---

## H.2 Scope Boundaries (When Activated)

If and when published, interoperability profiles may include:

- Domain- or context-specific profiles (e.g., manufacturing, logistics, energy)
- Optional interface subsets and configuration constraints
- Interoperability test conditions and scenario descriptions
- Environmental and operational assumptions
- Known limit

This annex defines functional human autonomy profiles for use in
cyber-physical system design. Profiles are contextual and non-diagnostic.

Classes defined: L, M, N, H, X.

Profiles describe interface requirements, not human worth, intelligence,
or authority.

UCPIS is designed to support participation across the full autonomy
spectrum through adaptive cyber-physical compensation.

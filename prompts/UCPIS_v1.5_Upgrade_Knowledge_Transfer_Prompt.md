# UCPIS v1.5 — Knowledge Transfer and Continuity Notes

**Document Status:** Informative / Internal Continuity Artifact  
**Public Visibility:** Permitted  
**Authority:** None  
**Version Context:** UCPIS v1.4 (Stable)

---

## Purpose

This document exists to **preserve context, posture, and continuity** across
working threads or private planning spaces while UCPIS v1.4 remains the active,
public architectural reference.

It is a **knowledge-transfer aid**, not a plan, roadmap, or commitment.

Nothing in this document:
- activates v1.5 work,
- modifies the public architecture,
- authorizes governance, implementation, or execution,
- or implies that a v1.5 release is planned or imminent.

If a v1.5 release ever occurs, it must be explicitly versioned, published,
and justified independently of this document.

---

## v1.4 Context (Locked)

A full harmonization pass has been completed across the UCPIS v1.4 corpus.

Key outcomes include:

- **White Paper v1.4**  
  - Three-layer conceptual architecture unified  
  - Environmental and biological context explicit  
  - Governance posture clarified  
  - MVUE constrained to conceptual framing only  

- **Annex A**  
  - Human Autonomy Classes formalized as informational  
  - Non-human biological entities treated as environmental context  

- **Annex C**  
  - Reference architecture aligned with Annex A  
  - Human and environmental integration clarified  

- **Annex D**  
  - Threat and resilience framing expanded  
  - Resilience defined as structural absorption  

- **Annex E**  
  - Alignment-only posture reinforced  
  - Public-domain and open-systems framing clarified  

- **Annex F**  
  - Authored but explicitly deferred until executable artifacts exist  

- **Annex G**  
  - Governance models deferred  
  - Anti-capture posture reinforced  
  - Human-only authority clarified  

- **Annex H**  
  - Interoperability profiles deferred  
  - Evidence-derived activation requirement recorded  

- Repository-wide alignment:
  - `Governance-Without-Capture.md`
  - `SECURITY.md`
  - `README.md`, `index.md`, `repository-structure.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`

All materials are internally consistent and institution-safe as v1.4.

---

## v1.4 Positions (Non-Negotiable)

The following positions are **locked** in v1.4:

- Informative, non-normative architecture only
- No compliance, certification, or enforcement
- No normative security controls
- Governance deferred; governance-without-capture posture
- Human authority and accountability only
- Animals and wildlife treated as environmental context
- Three-layer conceptual architecture (no additional layers)
- MVUE defined as conceptual only
- Annex F authored but deferred until code exists

These positions must remain intact unless explicitly revised via a future,
published version.

---

## v1.5 Posture (Continuity Framing Only)

This section records **how to think about a possible future revision** if one
ever becomes necessary.

Guiding distinction:

- **v1.4 = architectural coherence**
- **v1.5 (if any) = interpretability under observation**

A future v1.5 would exist only to:
- reduce misinterpretation,
- strengthen resistance to misuse,
- clarify boundaries already present in v1.4.

It would **not** exist to add scope, authority, or execution.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals for Any v1.5

A future v1.5 must not:

- Activate governance (Annex G remains deferred)
- Publish interoperability profiles (Annex H remains deferred)
- Define security controls
- Become a standards draft or certification regime
- Introduce vendor alignment or endorsements
- Expand human classifications into diagnostics or sociology
- Introduce ethical, welfare, or moral authority mandates

If any of the above are required, the project scope has changed and UCPIS
should not proceed under the same framing.

---

## Continuity Pillars (For Internal Reasoning Only)

These pillars describe *how to evaluate pressure*, not what to build.

1. **Misinterpretation Resistance**  
   Identify and close language paths that allow authority projection or misuse.

2. **Architectural Stress Awareness**  
   Describe stress conditions without prescribing controls, mitigations, or
   execution paths.

3. **Pre-MVUE Guardrails**  
   Prevent premature labeling of demos or prototypes as UCPIS artifacts.

4. **Evidence Intake Discipline**  
   Define what kinds of external evidence *could* justify revisiting deferrals,
   and what evidence explicitly does not.

---

## Internal Continuity Artifacts (Non-Public)

The following artifacts are **conceptual placeholders only**.  
They are **not documents to be published** unless explicitly re-authored.

### A. v1.5 Intent Memo (Internal Concept)

Purpose:
- Record internal reasoning if interpretability risks emerge
- Preserve posture continuity without public signaling

Status:
- Not authorized for publication
- Not evidence of future work

---

### B. v1.5 Preparation Checklist (Internal Concept)

Purpose:
- Track signals of misinterpretation or capture pressure
- Delay reaction until evidence is clear

Checklist categories may include:
- Misuse of autonomy classes
- Governance projection
- Premature implementation claims
- Anthropomorphization of environment or agents
- Vendor or institutional capture attempts

If pressure is observed:
- document it,
- do not respond reflexively,
- do not expand scope.

---

## Decision Boundary

A future version should proceed **only if**:

- clarification is demonstrably required,
- architecture remains the primary subject,
- no authority expansion is needed,
- deferral discipline can be maintained.

Otherwise:
- v1.4 remains sufficient,
- continued observation is the correct action.

---

## Status

This document is:
- a continuity aid,
- a guardrail against drift,
- and a reminder that **not acting is often the correct architectural choice**.

It carries **no authority** and defines **no commitments**.

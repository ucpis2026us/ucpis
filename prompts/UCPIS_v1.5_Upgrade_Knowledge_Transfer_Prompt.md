# UCPIS v1.5 Upgrade Knowledge Transfer (Internal)

Copy/paste this document into another working thread or private planning
space to carry forward the v1.5 posture and preparation artifacts while
continuing refinement of UCPIS v1.4.

---

## Context

A full UCPIS v1.4 harmonization pass has been completed across the
documentation corpus, including:

- White Paper v1.4  
  (structure corrected; three-layer model unified; explicit environmental
  and biological context; governance posture clarified; MVUE tightened to
  conceptual-only)

- Annex A  
  (Human Autonomy Classes formalized as informational; Non-Human Biological
  Actors added as environmental context)

- Annex C  
  (Reference Architecture updated to include environmental/biological
  context; human integration aligned to Annex A)

- Annex D  
  (Threat Model & Resilience expanded to include environmental and
  biological risk factors; resilience framed as structural absorption)

- Annex E  
  (Standards Alignment expanded to include public-domain civic principles
  and open systems; alignment-only posture reinforced)

- Annex F  
  (Reference Implementation Guidelines authored; minimal deltas for
  environment/biology acknowledgment; deferred until executable artifacts
  exist)

- Annex G  
  (Governance Models updated: deferred, anti-capture, human-only authority,
  environmental/biological context included)

- Annex H  
  (Interoperability Profiles updated: deferred, evidence-derived; profiles
  constrain interfaces, not authority; environmental/biological context
  included)

- Governance Without Capture statement  
- SECURITY.md  
- README.md, index.md, repository-structure.md  
- CHANGELOG.md and RELEASE_NOTES.md  

All materials are harmonized to UCPIS v1.4.  
LinkedIn references have been removed.  
Posture is stable and institution-safe.

## Key v1.4 Positions (Locked)

- Informative / non-normative architecture only
- No compliance, certification, or enforcement
- No normative security controls
- Governance deferred; governance-without-capture posture
- Human authority and accountability only
- Animals and wildlife treated as environmental context
  (not agents, not governance participants)
- Three-layer conceptual architecture
  (any additional “layers” are subdomains only)
- MVUE is conceptual only in v1.4
- Annex F is authored but deferred until code exists

---

## v1.5 Posture (High-Level)

Guiding concept:

- **v1.4 = coherence**
- **v1.5 = credibility under observation**

v1.5 is intended to strengthen **external interpretability and misuse
resistance**, not to add features, authority, or execution.

### Explicit Non-Goals for v1.5

v1.5 must **not**:

- Activate governance (Annex G remains deferred)
- Publish interoperability profiles (Annex H remains deferred)
- Define security controls
- Become a standards draft or certification program
- Introduce vendor endorsements or implementations
- Expand human classifications into diagnostics or sociology
- Add ethics, welfare, or moral authority mandates

---

## Four Pillars for v1.5 Preparation

1. **Misinterpretation Resistance**  
   Tighten language where ambiguity enables misuse. Add explicit
   “what this does NOT imply” guardrails.

2. **Non-Executable Architectural Stress Scenarios**  
   Describe stress conditions (energy constraint, human absence,
   environmental interference, governance fragmentation) without
   prescribing controls or mitigations.

3. **Pre-MVUE Guardrails**  
   Define what disqualifies a demo or prototype from being labeled an
   MVUE. Prevent premature capture via “reference implementations.”

4. **Evidence Intake Framing**  
   Define what kinds of external evidence *could* justify future
   activation of Annex H or Annex G — and what evidence explicitly does
   not.

## Internal Artifact 1: v1.5 Intent Memo

# UCPIS v1.5 — Intent Memo (Internal)

**Document Status:** Internal / Not for Publication  
**Prepared By:** Michael James Malecek  
**Date:** 2026  
**Related Public Version:** UCPIS v1.4  

### Purpose

This memo records internal intent for a potential UCPIS v1.5 release.
It does not authorize publication, scope expansion, or governance
activation.

v1.5 is intended to strengthen interpretability, resilience, and misuse
resistance without altering UCPIS’s non-normative, non-governing posture.

### Context

The primary post-v1.4 risk is **external misinterpretation**, not
technical insufficiency. v1.5 exists to address that risk *before* code,
pilots, or governance emerge.

### Intent (Non-Goals)

v1.5 will not activate governance, define controls, publish profiles, or
introduce executable artifacts. All deferrals remain intact.

### Focus Areas

- Misinterpretation resistance
- Architectural stress awareness
- Pre-implementation guardrails
- Evidence intake framing

### Release Posture

> “An interpretability and stress-readiness update to a stable reference
> architecture — not an expansion of scope or authority.”

### Decision Gate

Proceed only if external pressure or demonstrated confusion cannot be
responsibly ignored. Otherwise, v1.4 remains sufficient.

## Internal Artifact 2: v1.5 Preparation Checklist (Private)

# UCPIS v1.5 — Internal Preparation Checklist

**Status:** Private / Working Document  
**Do Not Publish**

### A. External Signal Tracking

- [ ] Readers inferring governance authority where none exists
- [ ] Requests focused on implementation rather than interpretation
- [ ] Human autonomy classes misused as hierarchy or evaluation
- [ ] Animals/environment anthropomorphized as agents
- [ ] Agent-agnostic interfaces mistaken for autonomy or compliance claims

---

### B. Language Stress Test

- [ ] Ambiguous terms enabling overreach
- [ ] Phrases implying inevitability or roadmap
- [ ] Sections collapsing architecture into policy or control
- [ ] Annex cross-references frequently misunderstood
- [ ] Language quotable out of context to imply authority

---

### C. Architectural Stress Scenarios (Non-Executable)

- [ ] Energy-constrained operation scenario
- [ ] Human absence or degradation scenario
- [ ] Environmental interference scenario
- [ ] Governance fragmentation scenario
- [ ] Failure-without-blame framing preserved

(No controls. No mitigations. No prescriptions.)

---

### D. MVUE Guardrail Readiness

- [ ] Clear disqualification criteria for invalid “MVUE” claims
- [ ] Language preventing vendor compliance assertions
- [ ] Explicit statement that demos ≠ adoption
- [ ] Clear separation between interface exercise and system validity

---

### E. Annex Stability Check

- [ ] Annex A terminology still sufficient
- [ ] Annex C architecture still internally consistent
- [ ] Annex D resilience framing intact without security creep
- [ ] Annex F deferral holding under pressure
- [ ] Annex G and H still safely deferred

---

### F. Governance & Capture Watch

- [ ] Pressure to formalize stewardship
- [ ] Requests for certification or conformance
- [ ] Attempts to centralize authority around UCPIS artifacts

If any occur → document pressure, do not respond reflexively.

---

### G. Release Decision Criteria

Proceed with v1.5 only if:
- [ ] Clarification is demonstrably required
- [ ] Architecture remains the primary subject
- [ ] No authority expansion is needed
- [ ] Deferral discipline can be maintained

Otherwise:
- [ ] Continue observation under v1.4

# Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)

The Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS) is an open,
non-proprietary reference architecture for coordinating artificial
intelligence, autonomous machines, manufacturing systems, logistics
networks, energy infrastructure, and human governance.

UCPIS defines a layered, interface-first architectural framework intended
to reduce fragmentation across cyber-physical systems by enabling
interoperability, modular substitution, and constraint-aware coordination.

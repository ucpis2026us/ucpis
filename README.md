# Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)

**Version:** v1.4  
**Status:** Public White Paper (Informative, Non-Normative)

The **Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)** is an
informative interoperability framework describing how heterogeneous
cyber-physical systems—machines, software, humans, and constraints—may
interoperate through a layered, interface-first architecture.

UCPIS is **not** a product, platform, standard, or implementation.
It defines no compliance requirements, certifications, or enforcement
mechanisms.

---

## Purpose

UCPIS exists to:
- Reduce fragmentation across cyber-physical systems
- Enable interface-first reasoning across physical, human, and cyber layers
- Treat real-world constraints (energy, labor, safety, governance, biology)
  as first-class architectural inputs

---

## Architecture Summary

UCPIS describes three conceptual layers:

1. **Layer 1 — Physical**
   - Machines, robots, sensors, actuators, energy and logistics interfaces

2. **Layer 2 — Human Interface / Mediation**
   - Constrained HMIs, guided workflows, confirmation and escalation paths

3. **Layer 3 — Cyber / Control / Governance**
   - Orchestration, scheduling, policy, audit, coordination logic

The architecture is **interface-first** and vendor-neutral.

## Human Autonomy Classes (Informational)

UCPIS describes human participation using informational classes:

- **Class-L:** Low-Autonomy Operators  
- **Class-M:** Mid-Autonomy Technicians / Supervisors  
- **Class-H:** High-Autonomy Architects / Leaders  
- **Class-X:** Augmented / Exceptional Autonomy (informational only)

These classes impose **interface constraints**, not value judgments.
